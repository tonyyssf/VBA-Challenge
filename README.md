#VBA-Challenge

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
 - The ticker symbol
 - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 - The total stock volume of the stock.

Added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

Made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

NOTE
Made sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
